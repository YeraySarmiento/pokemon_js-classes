# Pokemon

Javascript classes challenge about listing all Pokemon from the PokeApi with an API Rest.
It has been developed as a SPA, you can see all existing pokemon, catch your favourite and see them in your Pokedex section!

Own has been developed in a weekend during my ISDI Coders full-stack development bootcamp.


## Technologies

The front-end has been built with vanilla Javascript (using classes) and Jest for testing it.
